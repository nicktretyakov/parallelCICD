# ParallelCICD

A lightweight system for parallel continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) of machine learning and frontend projects.

## Features

- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple CI/CD tasks simultaneously.
- **Simple Startup**: Easy to run via a single shell script.
- **Support for ML and Frontend**: Designed for both machine learning pipelines and frontend workflows.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicktretyakov/parallelCICD.git
cd parallelCICD
```

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
